  - replace time picker with more useable one
  - reduce HTML tags (create / reuse Struts2 theme)

. pain points
  - service interface with domain objects IDs adds Request / Assembler
    => problems: more mapping code; constantly loading objects by ID from repositories
    => solutions: keep objects in web layer, but what about other clients?
  - transaction-bound EntityManagers require explicit attribute loading (Hydrater) to avoid LazyInitializationExceptions
    => problems: web layer affected by implementation choice; more code
    => solutions: OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter? Seam!
  - syntaxic / semantic validation
    => problems: logic is distributed
    => solutions: annotation-based validator? Hibernate Validator!
  - web layer still contain lots of code: reduce?
  - Struts2:
    . @ParentPackage duplication in actions
    . confusing use of literals and OGNL/EL expressions in tags
