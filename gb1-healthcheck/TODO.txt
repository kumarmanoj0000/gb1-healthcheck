  - streamline struts.xml (use annotations)

  - use HTML 4.01 Strict DTD (or XHTML?)
  - how to provide completion redirect to action?
  - improve Eclipse/Maven integration

. pain points
  - so many different APIs, so many configuration files (this is Java!)
  - Struts2 actions and results split in 2 files (struts.xml, applicationContext-actions)
  - global.css is getting big (split it up?)
  - AJAX-enabled pages take longer to develop and are harder to debug
