. pain points
  - so many different APIs, so many configuration files (this is Java!)
  - AJAX-enabled pages take longer to develop and are harder to debug (this is Ajax!)
  - bad integration between Eclipse and Maven (dependent vs WEB-INF/lib JARs)
  - Struts2 tags confusion: EL vs OGNL expressions
  - Struts2 i18n forcing use of <s:text>, <fmt:message> not working
  - lots of HTML tags to code
