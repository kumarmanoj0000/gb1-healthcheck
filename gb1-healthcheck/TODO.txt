. features:
  - user management
    * change own password

  - metrics analysis
    * correlation food <=> gastric states (generated image? Flex component?)
    * gastric states evolution (generated image? Flex component?)

  - reminders
    * send email when no meal saved in last 7 days

  - meals
    * use better time picker

  - global layout
    * replace content table by divs

. bugs:
  - edit user action should return to previous action, not necessarily workbench
    (if using ServletActionRedirectResult, WW-2170/2297 is blocking => use flash interceptor?)

. technical
  - use <s:token> to prevent double submit
  - create Struts2 theme to reduce HTML tags
  - write integration tests (Spring TestContext?)

. pain points
  - ServiceRequest / Adapter / PropertyProvider: more code, is it really useful?
  - Eclipse / Maven dependencies duplication (integration not ready; is it really useful?)
  - Tomcat restarts on every code change, even JSPs (Jetty? => debug?)
  - Struts2:
    . @ParentPackage duplication in actions
    . confusing use of literals and OGNL/EL expressions in tags
    . passing parameters with redirect result is not working: WW-2170/2297
