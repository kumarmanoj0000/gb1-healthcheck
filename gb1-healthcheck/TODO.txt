. technical
  1- migrate to Struts2 annotations (XML is verbose and far from code)
  - migrate to Spring annotations
  - improve Eclipse/Maven integration
  - split up global.css
  - migrate unit tests to JUnit 4 + Spring TestContext

. pain points
  - so many different APIs, so many configuration files (this is Java!)
  - AJAX-enabled pages take longer to develop and are harder to debug (this is Ajax!)
  - bad integration between Eclipse and Maven (dependent vs WEB-INF/lib JARs)
  - global.css is getting big (split it up?)
