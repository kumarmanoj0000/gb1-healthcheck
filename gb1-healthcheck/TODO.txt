. technical
  - upgrade to Spring 2.5.0
  - upgrade to Struts 2.0.11
  - use Struts2 annotations to declare converters and validators
  - fix @Transactional references on service methods
  - remove dependency to Spring MVC in POM file
  - migrate unit tests to JUnit 4 / TestNG
  - add README.TXT
  - use HTML 4.01 Strict DTD
  - how to provide completion result to action?

. pain points
  - repeating @Transactional on all service methods, especially exception lists (solved in Spring 2.5)
  - so many web files: ApplicationMessages.properties, struts.xml, applicationContext-actions, *conversion.properties, *validation.xml
  - duplications in ApplicationMessages.properties (use global namespace)
  - so many APIs, so many configuration files
  - long creation time for AJAX-enabled pages (use GWT!)
