. features:
  - gastric states evolution (Flex component)
  - correlation food <=> gastric states (Flex component)

. technical
  - prevent double submits (use <s:token> and TokenInterceptor / TokenSessionInterceptor)
  - replace time picker with more useable one
  - conversation scope (squeeze a wizard somewhere?)
  - reduce HTML tags (create / reuse Struts2 theme)
  - upgrade to Struts 2.1
  - upgrade to Hibernate Core 3.3

. pain points
  - ServiceRequest / Adapter / PropertyProvider: lots of code, is it really useful?
  - transaction-bound EntityManagers require explicit attribute loading (Hydrater) to avoid LazyInitializationExceptions: other solution possible? 
  - syntaxic / semantic validation is distributed: centralized solution possible?
  - Eclipse / Maven dependencies duplication (integration not ready; but is it really useful?)
  - Tomcat restarts on every code change, even JSPs (Jetty? => debug?)
  - Struts2:
    . @ParentPackage duplication in actions
    . confusing use of literals and OGNL/EL expressions in tags
