. technical
  - use Struts2 annotations to declare validators
  - streamline struts.xml (CodeBehind plugin?)
  - migrate unit tests to JUnit 4 / TestNG
  - improve use of HTML <label> tag
  - refactor duplicated messages in ApplicationMessages.properties
  - use HTML 4.01 Strict DTD (or XHTML?)
  - add README.TXT
  - how to provide completion redirect to action?
  - reduce number of classes per package?

. pain points
  - Struts2 actions and results split in 2 files (struts.xml, applicationContext-actions)
  - so many different APIs, so many configuration files (this is Java!)
  - global.css is getting big (split it up?)
  - AJAX-enabled pages take longer to develop and are harder to debug
  - JavaScript is dynamically typed, cannot use Java libraries (use jQuery?)
  - DOM tree is painful to manipulate (use jQuery?)
