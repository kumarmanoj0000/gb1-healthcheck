. features:
  - gastric states evolution (JFreeChart)
  - correlation food <=> gastric states (JFreeChart)

. technical
  - improve syntaxic validation: review annotations usage
  - integrate conversation management: implement ConversationInterceptor?
  - move transaction management up to web layer: implement TransactionInterceptor?
  - extend persistence context to conversation: implement OpenEntityManagerInConversationInterceptor?

. pain points
  - web state management
    => problems: done manually, error prone and fragile
    => solutions: conversation management, use narrower scope
  - services mostly delegate, but currently necessary for transaction boundaries => TransactionInterceptor then remove?
  - UI
    => problems: poor look and interactivity, lots of code required
    => solutions: Struts2 theme; JSF
  - Struts2:
    . @ParentPackage duplication in actions
    . confusing use of literals and OGNL/EL expressions in tags
