. technical
  - use annotations wherever possible (leverage Struts2 annotations)
  - upgrade to Spring 2.5.0
  - upgrade to Struts 2.0.11
  - migrate unit tests to JUnit 4 / TestNG
  - improve visual design (CSS)
  - add README.TXT
  - how to provide completion result to action?

. pain points
  - repeating @Transactional on all service methods, especially exception lists (solved in Spring 2.5)
  - so many web files: ApplicationMessages.properties, struts.xml, applicationContext-actions, *conversion.properties, *validation.xml
  - duplication in ApplicationMessages.properties (use global namespace)
  - so many APIs, so many configuration files
