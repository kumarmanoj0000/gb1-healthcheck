. features:
  - gastric states evolution (JFreeChart)
  - correlation food <=> gastric states (JFreeChart)

. technical
  - use DWR annotations
  - use conversation management
  - implement BeginTransactionInterceptor, OpenEntityManagerInConversationInterceptor
  - replace time picker with more useable one
  - reduce HTML tags (create / reuse Struts2 theme)

. pain points
  - transaction-bound EntityManagers require explicit attribute loading (Hydrater) to avoid LazyInitializationExceptions
    => problems: web layer affected by technical limitation; more code
    => solutions: OpenEntityManagerInView? BeginTransactionInterceptor + OpenEntityManagerInConversationInterceptor?
  - syntaxic / semantic validation
    => problems: logic is distributed
    => solutions: XWork validation, Hibernate Validator
  - web state management
    => problems: done manually, error prone and fragile
    => solutions: conversation management, use narrower scope
  - repositories mostly delegate to EntityManager => remove?
  - services mostly delegate, but currently necessary for transaction boundaries => BeginTransactionInterceptor then remove?
  - Struts2:
    . @ParentPackage duplication in actions
    . confusing use of literals and OGNL/EL expressions in tags
