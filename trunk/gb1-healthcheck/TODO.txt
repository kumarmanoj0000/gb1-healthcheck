. features:
  - user management
    * change own password

  - metrics analysis
    * correlation food <=> gastric states (generated image? Flex component?)
    * gastric states evolution (generated image? Flex component?)

  - reminders
    * send email when no meal saved in last 7 days

  - global layout:
    * replace content table by divs

. bugs:
  - create / update meal calendar popup takes whole screen
  - edit user action should return to previous action, not necessarily workbench

. technical
  - create Struts2 theme to reduce HTML tags
  - write integration tests (Spring TestContext?)
  - upgrade to Spring 2.5.2
  - upgrade to Hibernate Core 3.2.6, Annotations 3.3.1 and EntityManager 3.3.2

. pain points
  - ServiceRequest / Adapter / PropertyProvider: lots of code, is it really useful?
  - bad Eclipse/Maven integration (duplicated JAR dependencies; m2eclipse 0.9 and q4e 0.6 not ready; is it really useful?)
  - Tomcat restarts on every code change, even JSPs (Jetty? => debug?)
  - Struts2:
    . @ParentPackage duplication in actions
    . confusing use of literals and OGNL/EL expressions in tags
