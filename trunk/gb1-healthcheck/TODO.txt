. features:
  > reset user password by administrator
    * send email after reset
    * protect access using Acegi
  - correlation food <=> gastric states (generated image? Flex component?)
  - gastric states evolution (generated image? Flex component?)
  - send email when no meal saved in last 7 days
  - use better time picker
  - replace content table by divs

. bugs:
  - validation error redirects to URL with previous parameters in clear text (bad when dealing with passwords!)
  - edit user action should return to previous action, not necessarily workbench
    (if using ServletActionRedirectResult, WW-2170/2297 is blocking => use flash interceptor?)

. technical
  - use <s:token> to prevent double submit
  - create Struts2 theme to reduce HTML tags
  - write integration tests (Spring TestContext?)

. pain points
  - ServiceRequest / Adapter / PropertyProvider: more code, is it really useful?
  - Eclipse / Maven dependencies duplication (integration not ready; is it really useful?)
  - Tomcat restarts on every code change, even JSPs (Jetty? => debug?)
  - Struts2:
    . @ParentPackage duplication in actions
    . confusing use of literals and OGNL/EL expressions in tags
    . passing primitive with redirect result is not always working (WW-2170/2297)
    . flash scope not supported
