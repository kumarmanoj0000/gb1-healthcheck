. features:
  - gastric states evolution (generated image? Flex component?)
  - correlation food <=> gastric states (generated image? Flex component?)

. bugs:
  - edit user action should return to previous action, not necessarily workbench
    (broader technical concept: reusable workflows)
    (if using ServletActionRedirectResult, WW-2170/2297 is blocking => use flash interceptor)

. technical
  - scopes: flash (develop?), conversation => squeeze a wizard somewhere
  - use more useable time picker
  - prevent double submits (use <s:token>)
  - improve UI presentation
  - reduce HTML tags (create /reuse Struts2 theme)

. pain points
  - ServiceRequest / Adapter / PropertyProvider: more code, is it really useful?
  - Eclipse / Maven dependencies duplication (integration not ready; is it really useful?)
  - Tomcat restarts on every code change, even JSPs (Jetty? => debug?)
  - Struts2:
    . @ParentPackage duplication in actions
    . confusing use of literals and OGNL/EL expressions in tags
    . passing primitive with redirect result is not always working (WW-2170/2297)
    . flash scope not supported
  - cannot test Velocity-based email builders
