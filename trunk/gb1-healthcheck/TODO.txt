  - upgrade to Spring 2.5.1
  - upgrade to Struts 2.0.11 (2.1?)
  - use Struts2 annotations to declare converters and validators
  - fix @Transactional references on service methods
  - remove dependency to Spring MVC in POM file
  - migrate unit tests to JUnit 4 / TestNG
  - add README.TXT
  - use HTML 4.01 Strict DTD
  - how to provide completion result to action?
  - streamline struts.xml (CodeBehind plugin?)
  - investigate GWT web UI
  - add JDepend report

. pain points
  - repeating @Transactional on all service methods, especially exception lists (solved in Spring 2.5)
  - so many web files: ApplicationMessages.properties, struts.xml, applicationContext-actions, *conversion.properties, *validation.xml
  - duplications in ApplicationMessages.properties (use global namespace)
  - so many different APIs, so many configuration files
  - global.css is getting big, should it be split up?
  - AJAX-enabled pages are long to develop
  - JavaScript is dynamically typed, cannot use Java libraries
  - DOM tree is painful to manipulate
