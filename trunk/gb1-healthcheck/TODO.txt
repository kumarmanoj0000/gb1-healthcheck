. technical
  - improve Struts2 actions code
  - improve Eclipse/Maven integration
  - investigate Spring TestContext
  - migrate to Struts2 annotations (multiple action methods not supported in 2.0; what about 2.1?)
  - migrate to DWR annotations (no integration with Spring annotations in 2.0; what about 3.0?)

. pain points
  - so many different APIs, so many configuration files (this is Java!)
  - AJAX-enabled pages take longer to develop and are harder to debug (this is Ajax!)
  - bad integration between Eclipse and Maven (dependent vs WEB-INF/lib JARs)
